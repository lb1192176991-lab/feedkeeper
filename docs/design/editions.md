# Shared editions and native reading preferences

Status: base contract implemented in FeedKeeper `0.11.0`; linked overviews and explicit article limits are additive, unreleased extensions. The HTTP schemas are in [../openapi.yaml](../openapi.yaml); the wider native API is described in [native-api.md](native-api.md).

## Responsibilities and priority

The server owns one authoritative issue per user. It can select stories without an agent. An external agent uses MCP to inspect candidates, read original articles and publish a curated issue. Native apps display the ordered issue and cache it for offline reading.

1. An active curated issue takes priority until expiry or explicit dismissal.
2. Otherwise the server creates an automatic issue from the user's subscriptions and shared preferences.
3. An offline app keeps its cached issue, showing when it was last updated. A failed connection is not a dismissal or proof of expiry on the server.
4. Clients for other reader services can keep their existing local selection.

The web reader does not use these issues or native preferences. Its category ordering and article filters remain unchanged.

## Native preferences

Feature flag: `native-preferences`. `GET /api/v1/native-preferences` returns defaults with revision 0 until a user writes preferences. GET has no side effects.

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `timeZone` | `UTC` | Shared IANA time zone for issue boundaries. Apps adopt the user's current zone once or change it explicitly; devices must not overwrite it on every launch. |
| `editionSize` | `24` | Maximum articles, from 1 to 24. Automatic core selection defaults to 24; other producers may choose their own default while `editionSizeIsCustom` is false. |
| `editionSizeIsCustom` | `false` | Read-only marker for an explicit personal limit. A folder-only preference write never sets it. |
| `readingMinutes` | `null` | Optional approximate reading budget, from 5 to 180 minutes. An issue may include a single article longer than the budget. |
| `folderOrder` | `[]` | Ordered stable folder IDs for app sidebars and section controls. `null` may appear once for the unfiled section. Unlisted folders append in the order returned by `GET /folders`. |
| `hiddenFolderIds` | `[]` | Folders excluded from the newspaper, including automatic selection and new MCP publications. The ordinary article library stays available. |
| `preferredFolderIds` | `[]` | A modest selection boost. Hidden folders remain excluded even if preferred. |
| `showUnfiled` | `true` | Include subscribed feeds without a folder in the newspaper. |

`PATCH /native-preferences` merges only supplied fields. With `native-preferences.edition-size`, an integer `editionSize` sets `editionSizeIsCustom: true`, including an explicit 24; null resets it to false with the core fallback 24. Omission preserves the marker. `readingMinutes: null` removes the time budget. On older stored preferences, non-24 values are treated as explicit; legacy 24 is treated as an implicit default because historical folder-only writes stored 24 too. A user who deliberately chose 24 can select it again to retain that intent. Arrays replace their complete field. It requires `expectedRevision` and a UUID `requestId`; duplicate IDs, foreign folders, invalid zones and unknown fields are rejected. A successful first write records revision 1 even when it only adopts defaults. Later writes which change nothing retain the revision.

```json
{
  "requestId": "d3b258ec-5bc7-487c-9bca-e685c2b84d61",
  "expectedRevision": 0,
  "timeZone": "Europe/Berlin",
  "folderOrder": [12, 4, null, 9],
  "hiddenFolderIds": [9],
  "showUnfiled": true
}
```

The response is the full preference object with `revision` and `updatedAt`. Concurrent changes return HTTP 409 `{ "error": "revision_conflict", "current": { ... } }`. Keep the local draft, compare it to `current`, and merge or ask the user. A revised operation gets a new request ID and the current revision.

All folder IDs are scoped to the current account. Renames retain preferences. Deletion through native API, web API or MCP prunes the ID atomically from all three arrays, increments the preference revision and emits a sync change. A new folder with the same name gets its own identity.

### Adopting existing app settings

The app resolves its existing section names against stable IDs from `GET /folders` and sends its saved order and exclusions only when the shared preference revision is 0. Use a persisted request ID for the first upload. If another device has already initialized the settings, use the server version and retain any conflicting local intent for review; do not overwrite the shared settings on every device's first launch. A preferences upload must precede the first edition-generation request so the first shared issue observes the user's choices.

The server cannot read a device's current local settings itself. This contract prepares that transfer; apps still need to implement it. Presentation preferences apply immediately in app sidebars and section visibility. Selection settings affect the next issue; changing preferences does not silently rewrite an issue being read. `preferencesRevision` records which settings produced it.

## Automatic selection

Feature flag: `edition.automatic`.

- Eligible candidates are unread, currently subscribed articles from the last seven days. An absent or invalid publication date falls back to the stored date. Future-dated articles are not selected early.
- Muted keywords and hidden native sections are excluded. These exclusions affect the newspaper; native preferences never filter the web reader.
- Candidate gathering takes up to 40 articles per source, ordered by date, and at most 4000 total. This keeps a busy source from occupying the entire candidate pool.
- The base score decays with an 18-hour half-life and gives preferred folders a factor of 1.4. Photos and unsynchronized device opening counters do not influence selection.
- During selection, additional stories from the same source or folder receive diminishing weight. Initial caps favour diversity; caps relax to fill a small library without inventing stories.
- Canonical URLs remove known tracking parameters while preserving meaningful query parameters. Long identical titles and very similar word sets suppress likely duplicates. This is conservative text matching, not semantic event grouping.
- Stories offered in the retained history within 72 hours are considered after new candidates. The last 32 issues per user are kept; old original articles are not copied into the history.
- Reading estimates use cached content length. The optional budget is approximate; no external fetching or model call is needed to generate an issue.

The first selected article is the lead. Clients preserve the server's order; they can adapt columns and card sizes to each screen. Rich thematic grouping, semantic comparison and learning from cross-device reading habits are future work.

## Identity, time slots and replacement

Feature flag: `edition.revisions`.

Every new issue gets an opaque `id`, its own `createdAt`, `source` (`automatic` or `curated`), `period`, `expiresAt`, optional `title` and `summary`, `preferencesRevision` and ordered `itemIds`. The slot's `revision` increases on publication, dismissal and persisted expiry, and remains available after an issue ends. `GET /edition/state` returns `{ revision, status, edition }`, with `status` one of `none`, `active`, `expired`, `dismissed`; inactive state has `edition: null`.

Automatic time slots follow the shared zone: morning starts at 05:00, midday at 11:00, evening at 17:00 and late at 23:00. The late issue spans midnight. Boundaries account for daylight saving and fractional UTC offsets. Automatic issues expire at the next boundary.

At startup and once a minute the scheduler maintains users who have stored native preferences or already have an issue. Web-only users are not opted in merely by subscribing or reading. The app can also call `POST /edition/generate` with a UUID request ID to ensure an issue exists. `GET /edition` and `GET /edition/state` never generate an issue.

An active issue stays unchanged when articles are read, feeds are refreshed or preferences are edited. An explicit generation with `force: true` requires `expectedRevision`. If the selected IDs and order are unchanged, the existing issue is returned without a new revision. An active curated issue rejects forced generation with `curated_edition_active`; dismiss it explicitly first. No eligible articles yields `no_edition` unless an active automatic issue can be retained.

`DELETE /edition` dismisses the issue and advances the retained revision. Scheduling waits until the next time slot; an explicit forced generation may create an issue immediately. New clients send both revision and request ID. Empty-body deletion and unconditional MCP publication are retained for older clients; new integrations should always use conditional commands.

A time-based expiry is visible immediately through reads. The minute scheduler persists the transition and emits a sync tombstone or publishes a replacement; with no candidates, an expired state remains. Expiry followed by replacement may advance the revision twice. Revisions are ordered markers, not consecutive change counts a client must replay.

## MCP curation

Read tools:

- `get_native_preferences`: the same shared preferences as the native API.
- `get_edition`: current state and revision, including absence or dismissal.
- `get_edition_candidates`: compact bounded candidates, current state and preferences. Follow up with `get_item` when the original text matters.

Write tools:

- `update_native_preferences`: the same conditional PATCH contract.
- `generate_edition`: ensure or explicitly regenerate an automatic issue.
- `dismiss_edition`: conditional dismissal.
- `publish_edition`: publish 1–24 ordered, unique, accessible IDs with optional editorial text. It may deliberately include read, saved or annotated articles; subscribed hidden sections and muted items are rejected.

Recommended agent flow: read preferences and candidates, inspect selected originals, then publish with the observed `expectedRevision` and a persisted UUID `requestId`. On a conflict, reread and reconsider the selection before sending a new operation. The server remains the authority and never needs to run the agent itself.

`publish_edition` defaults to 24 hours. Supply either `durationHours` (positive, at most 168) or a future ISO `expiresAt` within seven days, never both. Automatic scheduling cannot replace active curation. Optional `title` (up to 200 characters) and `summary` (up to 2000) are editorial plain text, not replacement article content. Treat agent text and article content as untrusted input when rendering them or supplying them to another agent.

## Sync, receipts and offline copies

`/sync` delivers `native_preferences` with ID 1 and the complete settings, and `edition` with ID 1 and issue metadata. The metadata's string `id` is the issue identity; the outer numeric ID 1 identifies the user's singleton slot. Edition deletion data contains the retained `revision` and `status`. A first sync includes existing preferences and editions. Clients ignore unknown entities so older apps keep syncing notes, folders and item state.

Completed preference and edition commands store their result atomically with the write, including an empty generation result. A replay with the same request ID and payload returns the original metadata result, even if the account has moved on. Reusing an ID for another operation or payload returns `request_id_reused` (409). Receipts last at least 35 days; older replays need fresh state and a new operation. Validation failures and revision conflicts do not consume a request ID. Article objects hydrated for an HTTP response still reflect current article content and state; a `no_edition` response includes the current slot state so a client can recover from a late replay.

Apps retain offline drafts until acknowledgment. Apply monotonic revisions when a delayed response arrives, preserving newer local edits and queued changes. Keep cached issue articles, text and media offline. `limits.retention.protectActiveEdition` instructs clients to preserve active issue IDs alongside saved, annotated and unsynchronized articles. Server cleanup and unsubscribe paths apply the same protection, with access scoped to the issue's owner until expiry or dismissal.

A fresh 404 and an offline failure have different meanings. An expired cached issue may remain readable as a previous issue while the app waits for a replacement. When a new revision arrives during reading, offer the new issue without closing the reader or moving stories beneath the user. The API supplies the state; this presentation behaviour is implemented by clients.

## Upgrade and test deployment

Migration `0023_server_editions.sql` is additive: it introduces preferences, receipts and history and extends the existing edition slot. Existing curated issues retain their IDs, order, timestamps and revision; they receive an opaque issue identity. Legacy issues without an expiry receive a 24-hour expiry at migration time. Existing explicit expiries are retained. Notes, tokens and subscriptions are preserved.

Back up the database and article archive before deploying. Build and test before restart; startup applies the migration and starts edition maintenance. Deploy a tagged release with matching package versions and built assets. For an unpublished preview, use a distinct development version and keep its changes under Unreleased until publication is authorized.

## Linked overviews (unreleased)

Feature flag: `edition.overview`. `publish_edition` accepts optional `overview`, an array of 1–5 `{heading, segments}` blocks. Each segment has plain `text` and an optional positive integer `itemId`. The server requires at least one linked segment per block, validates every reference against the selected and access-checked `itemIds`, and rejects invalid links with `invalid_overview_reference`. Headings are limited to 160 UTF-16 code units, segments to 1000, at most 20 segments per block and 3000 visible code units in total. The server assigns stable per-issue IDs (`topic-1`, etc.). Native responses and sync include the stored overview. Older clients ignore it and display `summary`; when no summary is supplied, a plain-text fallback is derived from the blocks.

```json
{
  "itemIds": [123, 456],
  "expectedRevision": 7,
  "requestId": "d3b258ec-5bc7-487c-9bca-e685c2b84d61",
  "overview": [{
    "heading": "City plans three libraries",
    "segments": [{"text": "According to "}, {"text": "Local News", "itemId": 123}, {"text": ", the city plans three libraries in May."}]
  }]
}
```

Clients concatenate segments, create native article links from validated IDs, and never open URLs supplied by the producer. A link may only open a cached article from the displayed issue of the active account. Changing issues keeps the existing reader and offline retention behavior. Reference validation proves identity/access, not the truth of a producer's prose. Producers remain responsible for grounding claims in the originals.

Candidate payloads additionally include `sourceName` and `folderName`. The generic internal helper `cachedEditionSources(userId, itemIds)` provides access-checked cached reader/feed/snippet text, with no network fetching or scripts. It permits at most 24 distinct IDs, at most 6000 characters per article and 48000 total (UTF-16 units); it indicates `textKind` and may truncate source material. This is an internal extension point, not a new public full-text endpoint.

Migration `0025_edition_overview.sql` adds a nullable JSON column without changing existing editions, accounts or tokens. Consumers must build the current core before validation; core builds now emit declarations so downstream TypeScript contracts cannot silently use stale declaration files.
